                 The goal of the Global Foundations Core is to introduce
                 strategies to analyze and interpret the economic, social,
                 political, legal, cultural, and technological influences that
                 drive the global economy. The Business of Cuba course offers
                 an academic global experience in which students learn about
                 industry and business issues relevant to Cuba. The course
                 will focus on a specific business question/s of the
                 transitioning economic landscape in Cuba. The course is
                 designed to be a research-based, focused, hands-on learning
                 experience. Students will learn about Cubas economy,
                 businesses, history, politics, and culture to approach the
                 central learning question
