        X 70 :  All choral ensembles meet either MTR 2:30-3:50 PM, or daily
        4:00-6:00 PM. Students enrolled in MUS-X 70 must keep these time
        periods free until receiving an ensemble assignment following choral
        auditions
        Choral assignments for the entire school year are based on auditions
        held the week before classes in the fall semester.  If you did not
        audition at that time, you must audition on the first day of classes
        in the spring semester.  Please schedule an audition through the
        Choral Office, dvillanu@indiana.edu. See link on Choral Department
        website for audition details. If you auditioned in August, you do not
        need to re-audition in January
        For a complete list of choral ensembles, rehearsal dates, and times,
        please refer to the Choral Department website at HTTP://TINYURL.COM/Q9W6HKX.
        This information is also posted outside MA051.  There may not be
        openings in all ensembles in the spring semester if you did not
        audition in August
