                 Though a faculty member will be engaged as your instructor,
                 online courses require students to be especially
                 conscientious and responsible about completing assignments
                 and staying on track. Online courses are not easier than
                 residential courses and require just as much time and effort
                 from students. Online participation is required the first
                 week of class. Students may not add the class after Week 1 -
                 no exceptions.
                 Students must have a computer with a working microphone and
                 webcam. A private location and reliable internet connection
                 with a broadband speed of at least 5 mbps is required for
                 quizzes and exams.
