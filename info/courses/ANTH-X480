                 Above class requires permission of instructor.  Most entry
                 level archaeology jobs require a field school and this class
                 provides that qualification. This course will be held off
                 campus in St Clair County Illinois and is an opportunity for
                 students to learn the methods and theories of archaeology by
                 actually doing archaeology. Students will conduct excavations
                 in a 1000 year old village and survey areas surrounding
                 mounds and caves. Housing will be provided but entails a
                 housing fee  and instead of a textbook students will need to
                 assemble a dig kit.  For more information contact professor
