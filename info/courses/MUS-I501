                 Above class meets on Wednesdays, time TBA, once every three
                 weeks, starting the first week of classes.
                 This is a colloquium open to all interested music students
                 held once every three weeks for three hours (with a break) by
                 Profs. Andrew Mead (Music Theory) and Florence Sitruk (Harp)
                 on the question "what is musical taste?"
                 We will discuss debates of the early 18th (Quantz, C.P.E.
                 Bach and Mozart) and 19th Century (Wackenroder, Tieck) on the
                 subject, as well as look closely at philosopher Jacques
                 Derrida in the 20th century and his essays on political
                 correctness. We will follow the question "does political
                 correctness influence our judgment on taste?" All these are
                 vital questions for musicians interpreting scores of
                 composers. We will have guest speakers and expect a vivid
                 round of discussions.
