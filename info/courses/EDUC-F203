                 Above class meets first eight weeks only
                 In this course, students will begin to explore the personal,
                 institutional, political, and cultural forces that impact the
                 lived experience of being a professional teacher
                 Possible key questions for reflection include: How does
                 self-knowledge help teachers positively shape their
                 professional lives? How does school culture shape the
                 day-to-day life of teachers and how do you identify a school
                 culture that is right for you? How does the current emphasis
                 on standardized testing impact the life of a teacher and how
                 can teachers positively respond to this? What does it mean to
                 be a "role model" and what are the challenges and
                 opportunities presented by this social role? What does
                 community mean and how are teachers participants in and
                 facilitators of positive community?
                 Exploration of these questions will occur through student
                 centered, hands-on, and interactive classroom activities
