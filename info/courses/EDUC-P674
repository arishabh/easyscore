                 Students will engage in light reading and classroom
                 activities that support their professional development as
                 writers. 3-4 times per semester, students will bring in 2-3
                 pages of writing they would like to workshop. We will use our
                 time together to address and experiment with style and
                 organization, scholarly genres, and modes of discourse. The
                 weekly sessions will also address special topics dependent on
                 the needs of the class (e.g., writing research questions;
                 writing for specific audiences; writing about issues related
                 to equity, diversity, and inclusion)
