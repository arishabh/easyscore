                 Mapping Your Future: How to Make the Most Out of Your College
                 Experience is an eight-week, two credit, graded seminar
                 course designed for students to investigate the purposes of
                 an undergraduate education at IU Bloomington and to expose
                 them to the array of skills, tools, and opportunities that
                 academic advisors, career coaches, and the university have to
                 offer. The assignments and activities in the course include a
                 mixture of readings, class discussions, journaling,
                 out-of-class-activities, and a culminating semester project.
                 By the end of the course, students should have a better
                 understanding of themselves, their academic and career
                 interests, and a plan to maximize their opportunities as an
                 IU Bloomington student
