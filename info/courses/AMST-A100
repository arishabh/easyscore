                 Above class open to Freshmen and Sophomores only
                 Stars and Bars:  Pop Culture and Prison Although they stand
                 at the opposite end of political spectra in many ways,
                 popular culture and prison are two undeniably
                 quintessentially American phenomena.  This introductory
                 American Studies course examines the rise of mass
                 incarceration since World War II, focusing on popular
                 constructions in film, TV, and communications (news) media.
                 Students will be introduced to American studies methods of
                 popular cultural interpretation and to some brief histories
                 and activist framings of prisons and punishment.
