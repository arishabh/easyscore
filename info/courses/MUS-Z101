                 Z 101 : The listener is exposed to diverse types of music
                 through the exploration of European and American classics.
                 After initial units on world music and elements of music, the
                 course flows from the Middle Ages to contemporary times.
                 Students do not need a musical background to be in this class
                 but it is important that you have a love of music
